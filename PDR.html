            problem and synthesized research context for HoverHaul—an on-site
            delivery concept to move small, critical supplies across dynamic
            construction environments.

            Construction workers lose time and face safety risks because
            critical small-scale supplies like water and tools are not delivered
            directly to them, causing dehydration, downtime, and costly project delays.

          <p>
            Construction job sites face multiple overlapping problems that affect safety,
            efficiency, and overall productivity. One of the most pressing concerns is worker
            health, particularly hydration. Surveys show that many construction workers experience
            dehydration during shifts, which can lead to headaches, dizziness, and even serious
            health risks. Without regular water access, concentration drops and mistakes increase,
            creating safety hazards. The Hoover Dam construction project is a historical example
            that demonstrates the consequences of inadequate hydration, as extreme heat and poor
            water access endangered thousands of workers and slowed progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inefficiency is another widespread problem. Studies reveal that the average
            construction worker spends about 38 hours each year simply searching for misplaced
            tools. Beyond this, companies lose valuable time and money when equipment is stolen or
            goes missing. Research shows that poor organization, unclear schedules, and wasted
            labor hours add up to significant project delays and higher costs. This lack of
            structure is compounded by the enormous amount of waste produced in construction. The
            EPA reports that construction and demolition debris make up a large portion of total
            U.S. waste, raising environmental and logistical issues. Effective site layout planning
            is critical, but many projects fail to prioritize it, resulting in job site chaos and
            inefficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safety is the most critical challenge. The construction industry consistently records
            some of the highest workplace fatality rates. Falls, slips, and trips remain the
            leading cause of deaths and injuries, with OSHA, BLS, and legal studies all pointing to
            inadequate prevention strategies as a core issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, dehydration, wasted time, lost tools, poor layout planning, excessive waste,
            and high accident rates underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions.
